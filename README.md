# Cloud-Assisted-Access-Control-for-IoT

CHARIOT (Cloud-Assisted Access Control for the Internet of Things) is a policy-based access control protocol suitable for an IoT environment.
An IoT platform can verify IoT devices based on their attributes using a threshold attribute-based signature (ABS) scheme.
Furthermore, the computationally intensive signature generation can be offloaded from the IoT device to an untrusted, powerful cloud server. This is vital since IoT devices are severely constrained in memory and computational power.
