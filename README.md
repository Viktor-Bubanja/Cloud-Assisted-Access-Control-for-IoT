# Cloud-Assisted-Access-Control-for-IoT

CHARIOT (Cloud-Assisted Access Control for the Internet of Things) is a policy-based access control protocol suitable for an IoT environment.
Computationally intensive signature generation is offloaded from the IoT device to an untrusted, powerful cloud server. This is vital since IoT devices are severely constrained in memory and computational power.

CHARIOT utilises elliptic curve billinear group pairings, a threshold attribute-based signature (ABS) scheme, and Groth-Sahai non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems.
